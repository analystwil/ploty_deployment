I worked with Roza on this project for Improbable Beef. They are looking to identify a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef. Volunteers will be able to use the Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. They will also be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
